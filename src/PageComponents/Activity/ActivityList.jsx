//‚úÖ Now the Past Activities list updates in real-time when a new activity is added.

/**
 * üîπ Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:

{ activities } is destructured from props (equivalent to props.activities).
The component loops through the array (map()) and displays each activity in a list.
The key attribute is used to uniquely identify each activity element.


 *  Summary: Understanding Props in This Case
‚úÖ activities is a state variable in ActivityPage.jsx.
‚úÖ It is passed as a prop to ActivityList.jsx.
‚úÖ ActivityList.jsx receives the prop and displays the activities dynamically.
‚úÖ When the state (activities) changes, React automatically re-renders the UI.

How Does This Work in React?
Step-by-Step Breakdown
Step	Action	What Happens?
1Ô∏è‚É£	ActivityPage initializes activities with useState([])	The list starts as empty.
2Ô∏è‚É£	ActivityList is rendered	It receives activities as a prop.
3Ô∏è‚É£	User submits a new activity	  handleSubmit() updates activities in the parent (setActivities([...activities, newActivity])).
4Ô∏è‚É£	State changes	React re-renders ActivityList, and the new activity appears.
