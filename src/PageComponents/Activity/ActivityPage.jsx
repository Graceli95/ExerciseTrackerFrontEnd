/*
‚úÖ onAddActivity is a prop inside ActivityForm, but it refers to a function (addActivity) that was passed from the parent.
‚úÖ addActivity is a function that updates state (setActivities).

‚úÖ The ActivityPage component renders the ActivityForm and ActivityList components.
‚úÖ The ActivityPage component has a state variable activities that stores the list of activities.

useState Hook
The useState hook is a function that lets you add state to functional components in React. When you call useState, it returns an array with two elements:

1. The current state value.
2. A function that lets you update the state.
You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It tells React to re-render the component with the new state.

/**
 *
 * üîπ What this does:
 * useState([]): Creates a state variable activities to store the activities.
 * useEffect(...): Runs once when the ActivityPage component loads.
 * Calls getActivities(), retrieves the list of activities from the backend, and updates the state using setActivities(data).
 * 
 * üõ† How This Works
When ActivityPage loads, useEffect() runs.
It calls getActivities(), which fetches activities from the backend.
setActivities(data) updates the UI with the retrieved activities.
 */

/**
 * üìù Note: Passing a Function as a Prop
 *  Parent Component (ActivityPage.jsx) passes a function addActivity to the child component ActivityForm.jsx.
 *  This function is called when a new activity is created in the form.
 *  The new activity is then added to the list of activities in the parent component.
 * This is an example of how functions can be passed as props in React.
 * 
 * ActivityForm receives onAddActivity as a prop.
   onAddActivity={addActivity} means:
   The addActivity function is passed down to ActivityForm as a prop.
   Inside ActivityForm, it is called onAddActivity.

    When the form is submitted, the new activity is passed to the onAddActivity function.

 
  *Function (addActivity) in ActivityPage.jsx
 üí° What does addActivity do?

1.Takes newActivity as an argument (this is the activity saved from the backend).
2.Updates the state using setActivities(), adding the new activity to the list.
3.Re-renders the component so the UI updates automatically.


5Ô∏è‚É£ Summary: What‚Äôs Happening?
‚úÖ addActivity is a function in the parent (ActivityPage).
‚úÖ The function is passed down as a prop (onAddActivity).
‚úÖ The child (ActivityForm) calls this function when a new activity is created.
‚úÖ The function updates the state (setActivities), so React re-renders the list dynamically.

‚úÖ When onAddActivity(newActivity) is called:
setActivities([newActivity, ...activities]) updates the state.
React re-renders the UI, and the new activity appears in ActivityList.

üöÄ Final Takeaways
Props allow parent-to-child communication in React.
Functions can be passed as props, letting child components send data back to the parent.
React state updates dynamically, so the UI changes immediately without a full page reload.




| Step | Action | What Happens? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | `ActivityPage` renders | `ActivityForm` and `ActivityList` are displayed |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | User fills in form & submits | `handleSubmit()` runs in `ActivityForm` |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | API call is made | `postActivity(formData)` sends data to the backend |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | Backend saves activity | Returns the **newly created activity** |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | `onAddActivity(newActivity)` is called | **Updates state (`setActivities`)** |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ | UI updates dynamically | New activity **appears in the list** |
